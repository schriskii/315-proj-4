Type "make smaller30" to use a text file that's just the BEGINNING of small30, since small30 seemed kinda slow on my end.

Also, I think med30 might be faster than small30? Not sure, this project seemed kinda weird.

Uses the algorithm from the pdf, + a way to track which presentations have/haven't been graded in the current sequence.
